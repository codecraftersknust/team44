# Preface

![Team Logo](logo.png)

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2025.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains several schematic diagrams in form of PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It includes documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc.

## The Team

Our team consists of 3 members and a coach, we are Team44 from Ghana. This is our second year competing together in WRO Future Engineers, but this is our first year for some team members.

## Past Experiences

   **Last year, our team participated in the WRO Future Engineers category as Pathfinders.** Although our robot was not able to run during the competition, the experience was invaluable. We learned a great deal from observing other teams and reflecting on our own journey.

   Since then, we have become much more comfortable with the Linux operating system, and Arduino programming is now at our fingertips. We have also gained skills in Fusion 360 modeling, PID control, and using OpenCV for computer vision tasks. These experiences have strengthened our technical foundation and prepared us better for this season.


## Teamwork
Our team maintained consistent progress by meeting *weekly after lectures and sometimes on weekends* to work together in person. Between meetings, each member focused on their specialized areas—whether hardware, software, or documentation—and shared updates *via GitHub pull requests*. This allowed us to review, test, and integrate changes efficiently, especially when one of us could test code directly on the robot in the lab. **Clear communication was key:** we regularly messaged to align on priorities, avoid redundancy, and ensure no one got stuck. While we each took ownership of specific tasks, we made sure to cross-train and explain our work to the whole team. This balance of individual focus and collective review kept our project moving forward steadily, even with limited in-person time.

## Final Reflections
This project pushed us to our limits, but seeing how much we've accomplished *fills us with pride and excitement* for what's next. Through countless hours of problem-solving, *we gained hands-on experience with various communication protocols, hardware integration, and complex system design.* Every challenge became an opportunity to learn, and every setback taught us something new. *While the road was tough*, the knowledge we've gained and the skills we've developed made every moment worthwhile. We're walking away not just with a functional robot, but with **invaluable engineering experience** that will serve us far beyond this competition.

## Special Thanks
We are deeply grateful to the **Responsible AI Lab** at KNUST for their generous funding and equipment support that made this project possible. Our sincere appreciation also goes to the KNUST **College of Engineering Innovation Center** for providing us with workspace and resources for our practice sessions. We'd like to thank the **Council for Scientific and Industrial Research - Institute for Scientific and Technological Information** for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey. Finally, we couldn't have done this without the patience and encouragement of our **friends and families**, who supported us through countless late nights and tolerated our robot taking over their spaces.
